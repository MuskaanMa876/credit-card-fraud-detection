# credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit card fraud is a serious issue that affects millions of users worldwide. This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. We train a model on transaction data and classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
*Dataset*

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.
It contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent (highly imbalanced data).
Features: The dataset has 30 numerical features, including V1 to V28 (PCA components), Time, and Amount.
Target Variable:
0 → Legitimate transaction
1 → Fraudulent transaction
Project Objectives
Preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, scaling, and balancing).
Train different machine learning models to classify transactions.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
